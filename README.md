# Odd or Even Cricket Game

A fun and simple cricket-style game where the player competes against the computer using an odd or even twist. The player and computer select numbers, and the outcome of the game depends on these selections. The objective is to accumulate points without getting out.

## Overview

This Python-based game is a unique take on cricket, focusing on odd and even numbers. The user competes with the computer by selecting odd or even numbers. The game involves rounds where both the player and the computer select numbers, and based on these numbers, the player can either score points or get out.

## Features

- Player vs. Computer gameplay.
- Randomized computer choices using Python's `random` module.
- Choice-based play between odd and even numbers.
- A scoring system that tracks the user's score until they get out.

## Rules

1. The player and the computer each select a number between 1 and 6.
2. If the sum of the numbers is odd or even, depending on the user's choice, they either score points or face the risk of getting "out."
3. The game continues until the player is "out," at which point their total score is displayed.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Game logic and random number generation.

## Game Play Instructions
-When prompted, select if you want to play as "odd" or "even."
-Enter a number between 1 and 6 to make your choice.
-The computer will randomly select its number.
-The result of each round will be displayed, showing if the player scored or got "out."
-The game keeps a running total of the player's score, which resets to zero upon "out."

## Future Improvements
-UI Enhancements: Add a graphical interface for a more interactive experience.
-Multiplayer Mode: Enable two-player gameplay.
-Improved Scoring System: Track scores across multiple sessions or rounds.
